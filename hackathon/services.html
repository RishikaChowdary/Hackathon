		 he or she is transferred to a surgical intensive care unit equipped to deal with acute needs</p>

	`   <h3>Outpatient care</h3>
              <p>Outpatient or ambulatory surgery services make up almost half of all surgeries in the United States as a result of advances in surgical equipment and technique that allow for laser treatments and other minimally invasive procedures.
		 Outpatient procedures require comparatively little aftercare for the patient due to both the nature of the surgical procedure and the advantages of being able to use regional or local anesthesia.
